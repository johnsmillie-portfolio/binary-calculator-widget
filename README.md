### About
This project uses JavaScript classes to bootstrap a widget that functions as a binary calculator and converter. The widget is appended to the document when the page loads. 

### How It Behaves
Arithmetic operations are resticted to the selected bit-size. Overflow with truncation, 2's complement representation of negative integers, and integer division can be expected. To perform conversions, enter the binary input and press the equals button.
