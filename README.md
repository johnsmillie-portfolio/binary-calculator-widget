### About
This project uses JavaScript to bootstrap a widget that functions as a binary calculator. The main.js simply appends a new div containing the widget when the page loads.

### How It Behaves
The calculator mimics 32-bit signed integer arithmetic. <b>A leading 1 digit will be interpreted as a negative number using 2's complement;
            results should also be interpreted as 2's complement</b> (there is not a fixed bit size). Integer division and integer overflow (undefined) behavior can be expected.
            Conversion operations will be added at a later time.
