        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This project is based on a Hackerrank Challenge. 
            The concept of JavaScript Modules was used to design a fixed-size, widget-style binary calculator 
            that is appended to the document when the page loads. 
        </p>
        <h3>How It Behaves</h3>
        <p>
            The calculator mimics 32-bit signed integer arithmetic. <b>A leading 1 digit will be interpreted as a negative number using 2's complement;
            results should also be interpreted as 2's complement</b> (there is not a fixed bit size). Integer division and integer overflow (undefined) behavior can be expected.
            Conversion operations will be added at a later time.
        </p>
