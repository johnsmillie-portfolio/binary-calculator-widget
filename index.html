        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This project is based on a Hackerrank Challenge. 
            The concept of JavaScript Modules was used to design a fixed-size, widget-style binary calculator 
            that is appended to the document when the page loads. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The calculator mimics 32-bit signed integer arithmetic. Thus, a leading 1 digit will be interpreted using 2's complement;
            results should also be interpreted as 2's complement. Furthermore, integer division behavior can be expected. 
            Conversion operations will be added a later time.
        </p>
